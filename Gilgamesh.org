#+TITLE: Gilgamesh
#+SUBTITLE: The modular quadcopter made from scratch

* Overall layout
Gilgamesh is a drone that has been designed from the start trying to maintain a sense of modularity.
As such, the overall electrical model has been split over three main sections.
- A flight management unit, which is responsible for aerial control and the radiofrequency links, as well as extra functionality such as camera image capture.
- A motor controller unit, responsible for the movement, speed and control of the BLDC motors.
- A power monitor, responsible for the monitoring of each 18650 battery cell, overall safety measures and finally distributing the power to the rest of the system.

* Flight Management Unit (FlightManagement)

* Motor Controller Unit (MotorControl)

* Power and battery Monitoring Unit (PowerMonitor)
